Upon awakening in the Llinger Kingdom, King Lloyd informs them that they have been summoned as heroes to defend the Kingdom from the Demon Lord and his army, which were repelled after attacking the kingdom two years ago and is now preparing for another attack, and that there is currently no way to return them to their world. It turns out that only Inukami and Kazuki were meant to be summoned and that Usato was brought along by chance. When the three are tested to determine what magical powers they possess, Usato discovers that he is able to use healing magic, which is extremely rare, but also considered to be weak and almost useless compared to other forms of magic. Upon learning this, Rose, the captain of the Kingdom's Rescue Team, enlists him in her team and begins training him to be a healer on the front lines of battle, while Inukami and Kazuki are trained as warriors. As the day of battle approaches, Usato aims to save as many people as possible and show the world that healing magic is not to be underestimated.",
